# Snowboard2003 🏂

## Description
🥽 Welcome to Snowboard2003, a 2D snowboarding game filled with excitement, humor, and fun gameplay! <br> <br>
❄️ Drawing inspiration from the ice cap zone level from Sonic 3, the level theme sets the stage for an immersive and nostalgic experience, reminiscent of the retro gaming era! The name Snowboard2003 gets its name because I tried to replicate the aesthetic from that era of early computer flash games. <br> <br>
💻Snowboard2003 was made during the Global Game Jam Concordia 2024, where I immersed myself in the new world of game development. Through dedication and creativity, I learned the fundamentals of the Godot engine and crafted an immersive snowboarding experience. <br> <br>
🎵 The character art, sound effects and music is all made by myself. 


## Gameplay
🕹Gameplay loop: Navigate through dynamically scrolling slopes, where your star character gains momentum as you descend (and gets squishier with the speed). The level is an auto scroll level, so strategize your movements to maintain control and maximize speed.<br> <br>
🎮Controls:
- jump: SPACE
- reset: R
- flip: W/UP ARROW

<br>📍The Goal: Do flips and tricks! Each successful trick earns you points, and just like old-school games, you want to get the highest score possible.<br> <br>
⚠️Avoid Spikes: Beware of obstacles scattered throughout the course. Spikes pose a threat by slowing you down and deducting points from your score. Stay vigilant and maneuver skillfully to evade them. <br> <br>
🔊The fun twist: The theme for the gamejam was to make a funny game. Since it was the first game I made I wanted to make a game I would enjoy playing and didn't want to make a gimmicky Wario Ware type game. So I tweaked every sound effect to sound fun and the sound mess when events accumulate is pure gold. I took inspiration from sonic rush when you do figures and the sound effects just keep piling up like wild.
## Challenges
- Understanding the Godot Engine was a challenge, since Godot has recently made a new update, a lot of the documentation available is outdated.
- Keeping the character in place on slopes. Since there is gravity involved the character kept bouncing a lot so after extensive research I finally found the one setting to change to prevent exessive bumping
- Figuring out how to put audio in game. It wasn't well documented and I struggled to find a way to have the sound effects in game, and to make it randomized.
